# flugfeld
Maintained list of worldwide airfields with gliding activity with number of launches and link to OpenAIP. 

This list is used internally at WeGlide to make airports appear on the map based on their 'importance' in the gliding world.
We will sync the number of flights from the airfields (uploaded on WeGlide) on a yearly basis and order the list based on those numbers.

## Contributing
If you find an airfield with gliding activity missing, there are two steps.

- make sure it is available on OpenAIP[https://www.openaip.net/] - if not, you can add it there
- add the missing row and open a PR

## Naming
Naming of the gliding sites is following local conventions, so if you spot an error, please open a PR. 

## Missing

Areas with missing information include:

- Russia
- South America
- Japan 

This in parts due to airport information missing on OpenAIP
